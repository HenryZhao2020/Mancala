        <p>A <u>Pocket</u> is a small pit.</p>
        <p>A <u>Store</u> is a large pit on each side.</p>

        <h3><u>How to Play</u></h3>
        <p>First player chooses a Pocket on their own side, picks up the stones in that Pocket, and starting with the next Pocket, drops one stone in each Pocket going counterclockwise (including the Store) until all of the stones are played out.</p>
        <p>Now it is the other player's turn to do the same using stones on their side and continuing to play counterclockwise.</p>
        <p>If there are enough stones to reach the other player's Store, skip that Pocket and continue on your own.</p>
        <p>If your last stone goes into your Store, you get to go again.</p>
        <p>If your last stone goes into an empty Pocket on your side, move that stone and any captured stones (those directly across on your opponent's side) to your Store.</p>
        <p>The game ends when either player has no more stones in their six Pockets.</p>
        <p>The remaining stones go to the other player's Store.</p>
        <p>The winner is the player with the most stones in their Store.</p>
