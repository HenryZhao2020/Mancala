        A <u>Pocket</u> is a small pit.
        <br>
        A <u>Store</u> is a large pit on each side.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are 12 Pockets:
        <br>
        <label style="color: #FF3333">-   6 on the player's side.</label>
        <br>
        <label style="color: #0080FF">-   6 on the computer's side.</label>
        <br>
        <br>
        There are 2 Stores:
        <br>
        <label style="color: #0080FF">-   1 at the left for computer.</label>
        <br>
        <label style="color: #FF3333">-   1 at the right for player.</label>

        <br>
        <br>
        First player chooses a circle on their own side,
        picks up the stones in that Pocket,
        and starting with the next Pocket,
        drops one stone in each Pocket going counterclockwise (including the Store) 
        until all of the stones are played out.
        <br>
        <br>
        Now it is the other player's turn to do the same using stones on their side 
        and continuing to play counterclockwise.
        <br>
        <br>
        If there are enough stones to reach the other player's Store,
        skip that Pocket and continue on your own.
        <br>
        <br>
        If your last stone goes into your Store, you get to go again.
        <br>
        <br>
        If your last stone goes into an empty Pocket on your side, 
        move that stone and any captured stones 
        (those directly across on your opponent's side) to your Store.
        <br>
        <br>
        The game ends when either player has no more stones in their six circles.
        <br>
        <br>
        The remaining stones go to the other player's Store.
        <br>
        <br>
        The winner is the player with the most stones in their Store.
